# The Persistence of Memory
CS379C Spring 2018 Final Project - Computational Models of the Neocortex

Simple computational model of hippocampal visual memory trace formation based on the following hypothesis: hippocampal memory trace formation can be modeled as preserving neural network activations in response to inputs, and consolidation can be modeled as increasing sparsity in the stored representations.
